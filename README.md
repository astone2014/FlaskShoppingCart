# Python Shopping Cart
##### AUTHOR: Austen Stone

## Description
This project is an asynchronous online shopping application that was developed in Python. Using the Flask framework to act as a web server user can query an SQL database full of products. AJAX is used to create a better and more dynamic user experience that doesnâ€™t require the constant page reloading that most PHP shopping carts use.
  
## Instructions
This project was built in VS 2017 so you'll see some project files lying around. Feel free to use project files or browse "FlaskWebProject1" to see all the code. Run "runeserver.py" to get Flask server started. You may need to pip install Flask and a few other libraries.
